1 Project Checkpoints 

You are required to create four discrete checkpoints for your semester project. Time management is an important part of long-term projects. The graduate students of this class are developing this skill as they work on their thesis. If you save most of the work until the end, you will not succeed. Estimation is an important skill you must learn in industry, so we will practice for the semester-long project. Agile development methodologies espouse a concept of dividing work into chunks called sprints. A sprint is an arbitrary length of time, typically a number of weeks. You have roughly 12 weeks left until your project is due. We will break the time into four three-week sprints. 
I will hold you accountable to these checkpoints.
